            We follow relevant privacy and education laws, including COPPA (for children’s online

          <p>
            We collect a limited set of information so we can personalize learning, keep the platform
            secure, and meet our legal obligations. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Profile information</strong> such as name or display name, email address,
              age or date of birth (for age gating and parental consent), role (student, parent,
              educator, etc.), and educational level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning interactions and artifacts</strong> such as the questions you ask,
              the responses you receive from the AI, and any saved summaries, plans, or learning outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emotional and engagement signals</strong> that you choose to share in your
              messages (for example, saying you feel “stressed,” “confused,” or “excited”) to help
              the system adjust its tone and pacing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical data</strong> like browser type, device type, IP address,
              approximate region, and error logs so we can keep the platform secure and functioning properly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information. We use data only to provide and
            improve the learning experience, support schools, and meet our legal and security requirements.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For children under the applicable age threshold (typically under 13 in the United States),
              we use age gating and obtain verifiable parental or guardian consent before collecting
              personal information beyond what is strictly necessary for basic functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              When CogMyra is provided through a school or district, some information may be considered
              educational records under FERPA. In those cases, we act as a service provider to the school,
              and the school remains the primary data controller for education records.
            </li>
            <li>
              We limit data collection from minors to what is needed for educational purposes, and
              parents/guardians can request access, correction, or deletion of their child’s information.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Parents, guardians, and schools can contact us any time at

      <h2>Full Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how CogMyra (“CogMyra,” “CogMyra Guide,” “CMG,” “we,” “us,”
        or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information about users of the CogMyra Guide AI
        learning platform, including learners, parents and guardians, educators, and professionals.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in a safe, transparent,
        and compliant way. We design CogMyra Guide to support personalized learning while respecting
        applicable laws, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (<strong>COPPA</strong>)</li>
        <li>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<strong>FERPA</strong>) where used by schools</li>
        <li>General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>GDPR</strong>) where applicable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use CogMyra Guide.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

      <p>We collect three broad categories of information:</p>

      <h4>1.1 Information You Provide Directly</h4>
      <p>This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and profile details</strong> such as name or display name, email address,
          age or date of birth (to support age gating and parental consent), role (e.g., student,
          parent, educator, professional), and educational level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning interactions and content</strong> such as questions you ask and inputs
          you provide to the AI, responses generated by the system in your sessions, and saved
          “artifacts” such as summaries, plans, and exported materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support and communications</strong> such as messages you send to us for help,
          feedback you provide about the platform, and participation in surveys, pilots, or
          research studies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h4>
      <p>
        When you use CogMyra Guide, we automatically collect certain technical and usage data, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser and device type, operating system, and basic device settings.</li>
        <li>IP address and approximate location (country or region level, not precise GPS).</li>
        <li>Session activity, timestamps, and error logs.</li>
        <li>
          An anonymous user identifier (for example, a cookie or similar identifier such as
          <code>cmg_uid</code>) used to remember your session, preferences, and learning history
          on a given device.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>1.3 Emotional and Behavioral Signals</h4>
      <p>
        CogMyra Guide may infer or receive information about your emotional state or engagement, for
        example when you indicate you feel “stressed,” “confused,” or “excited,” or when similar
        signals appear in your messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use these signals only to adjust tone, pacing, and support to improve the quality of the
        learning experience. We treat this type of information with particular care and do not use
        it for unrelated purposes such as advertising.
      </p>

        <li>Maintain the security and integrity of the platform.</li>
        <li>Debug, monitor, and improve performance and reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2.2 To Support Compliance and Safety</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Verify age and identify when parental consent is required.</li>
        <li>Comply with school or institutional agreements, where applicable.</li>
        <li>Monitor for misuse, abuse, or security threats.</li>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.</p>

      <h3>3. Legal Bases for Processing (GDPR)</h3>

      <p>Where GDPR applies, we process personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> When you (or your parent/guardian, for minors) give clear
          permission, especially for account creation, use of certain data types, or participation
          in pilots or research.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To provide the educational services you request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal obligations:</strong> To meet obligations under applicable laws (for example,
          COPPA, FERPA, tax, and audit requirements).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To maintain and improve platform security and
          functionality, conduct internal analytics in de-identified form, and develop new features—
          balanced against your rights and expectations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may withdraw consent at any time where consent is the basis for processing.</p>

      <h3>4. Children’s Privacy and Parental Consent</h3>

      <p>
        CogMyra Guide is designed for learners of different ages, including minors. For users under
        the relevant age threshold (typically under 13 in the United States), we:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use age gating to identify minors and trigger a parental or guardian consent process before
          collecting personal information beyond what is strictly necessary for basic functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limit data collection from children to what is necessary for educational purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide parents and guardians with the right to review their child’s information, request
          corrections, or request deletion of the child’s personal data, subject to legal and
          operational requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without appropriate
        consent, we will delete it as soon as reasonably possible.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Educational Records (FERPA)</h3>

      <p>
        When CogMyra Guide is provided to students through a school, district, or educational
        institution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some information may be considered “education records” under FERPA.</li>
        <li>
          We treat the school or institution as the primary data controller for those records and act
          as a service provider/processor.
        </li>
        <li>
          We only use education records consistent with our agreement with the institution and
          applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>We do not use FERPA-covered education records for targeted advertising.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Schools and institutions are responsible for providing required notices to students and
        families and for handling certain FERPA rights requests. We support them as specified in our
        agreements.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>

      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</p>

      <p>We may share information in limited circumstances, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers and vendors:</strong> Companies that help us operate the
          platform (such as hosting providers, infrastructure services, or email delivery tools).
          These providers may access data only to perform services on our behalf and are bound by
          contractual obligations to protect confidentiality and comply with applicable laws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Schools and institutions:</strong> When CogMyra Guide is used through a school or
          institution, we may share relevant information with authorized school staff according to
          our agreement with the institution and applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and safety reasons:</strong> When required by law, regulation, legal process,
          or government request; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of CogMyra, our users,
          or the public.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If CogMyra is involved in a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction, we may transfer
        information as part of that transaction, subject to continued protection consistent with
        this Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Data Retention</h3>

      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in
        this Policy or as required by law. In general:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account and profile information:</strong> Retained while your account is active
          and for a reasonable period afterward (typically up to 3 years) for purposes such as
          reactivation, legal obligations, dispute resolution, and security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning progress and interaction history:</strong> Retained while your account
          is active and for a reasonable period afterward (typically up to 3 years) to support
          learning continuity, institutional needs, and internal analytics in aggregate or
          de-identified form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Events, emotional and behavioral signals, and certain artifacts:</strong>
          Typically retained for a shorter window (for example, around 180 days) to support recent
          learning continuity, personalization, and safety, then deleted or de-identified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Technical logs and diagnostic data:</strong> Typically retained for about 12 months
          to support security monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis, then deleted or
          de-identified.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When data is no longer needed, we either delete it securely or de-identify it so it can be
        used in aggregate, non-personal form (for example, to understand feature usage or improve the
        system) without identifying individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you request deletion of your data, we will honor the request consistent with our Data
        Deletion / Right to be Forgotten processes and subject to any legal requirements to retain
        certain records.
      </p>

        <li>Maintain session security and integrity.</li>
        <li>Understand basic usage patterns to improve the service.</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <h3>9. Security Measures</h3>

      <p>
        We use a combination of technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards designed to
        protect your data, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Encryption of data in transit and at rest where appropriate.</li>
        <li>Access controls and role-based permissions for staff and systems.</li>
        <li>Regular security and compliance reviews.</li>
        <li>Backup and recovery procedures to maintain availability and integrity.</li>

          Monitoring, logging, and incident response procedures to detect and manage potential
          security events.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, but we work continuously to reduce risk and
        improve our defenses.
      </p>
