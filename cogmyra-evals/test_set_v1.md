## Prompt 1 — Young Learner / Fractions

### **B. CogMyra Guide GPT Response**
Hey there—since you’re 9 and sometimes get distracted (that’s totally normal!), let’s make fractions feel simple and kind of fun.
Imagine you have a pizza. If you cut it into 4 equal pieces and eat 1 piece, you ate one out of four pieces. That’s a fraction:
The top number tells how many pieces you have.
The bottom number tells how many equal pieces the whole thing was cut into.
Try this:
If you cut a brownie into 8 equal squares and take 3, what fraction of the brownie is yours?

### **B. CogMyra Guide GPT Response**
Let’s keep this super clear for a 3rd grader.
Plants make their own food—kind of like tiny chefs. Here’s how:
They take sunlight (their energy).
They breathe in carbon dioxide from the air.
They drink water through their roots.
Then inside their leaves, they mix it all together to make sugar (their food) and release oxygen for us to breathe.
Sun + water + air → plant food.

### **B. CogMyra Guide GPT Response**
First, you’re not “dumb.” You’re someone trying to learn something tricky, and that’s brave.
Here’s the secret to dividing fractions:
Keep – Change – Flip.
Keep the first fraction the same.
Change the division sign to multiplication.
Flip the second fraction (turn it upside down).
Then multiply straight across.
